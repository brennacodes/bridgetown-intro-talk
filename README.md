# Bridgetown Intro Talk

This is a talk that I gave to the [Boulder Ruby User
Group](https://boulder-ruby.org) on 2023-04-12.

1. Install Bridgetown
```
gem install bridgetown
```
2. Run `bundle` to install all gems from the Gemfile
3. Run `bin/bridgetown build` (not sure if this is necessary, but I think it is)
4. Run `bin/bridgetown start` to start the server
5. Visit `localhost:4000`
